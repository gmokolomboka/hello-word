Angular6App

An Angular and TypeScript init Project
This project is an Angular 6 starter project that has the npm modules, configuration, scripts and folders in place to make getting started with an Angular project easy!

Here's what is in the project:

Angular scripts and TypeScript configuration are ready to go
A simple app component
Bootstrap for CSS
This is a very simple project to help get you started.

I use Visual Studio Code, install my Angular code snippets to simplify the process of writing Angular code. 
The code snippets make it easy to build Angular components, services, pipes, directives and more.

Running the Application
Install the Angular CLI

npm install -g @angular/cli

Run npm install

Run npm start
